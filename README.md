# Structure Data Stack Assignment
## Definition

1. new Stack(): Creates an instance of a Stack class that doesn't contain any items. The constructor does not accept any arguments.

2. push(): Pushes an item onto the top of the stack and returns the new length of the stack. Required time complexity: O(1).

3. pop(): Removes an item at the top of the stack and returns that item. Required time complexity: O(1).

4. isEmpty(): Determines if the stack is empty. Required time complexity: O(1).

5. peek(): Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it from the stack. Required time complexity: O(1).

6. length(): Returns the number of items in the stack. Required time complexity: O(1).

## Instructions:

Use above stack and solve the below problem:
	
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
		An input string is valid if:
			a. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
			b. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
			c. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Output
Test cases:
1. ()
2. ()[]{}
3. (]
4. ([])
